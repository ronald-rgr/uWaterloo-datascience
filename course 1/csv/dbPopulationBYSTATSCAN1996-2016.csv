2,"This compilation of statistics uses historical Census of Population data that have been derived from small-area census information (enumeration areas for 1971 to 1996, census blocks for 2001 and dissemination blocks for 2006 to 2016). Enumeration areas, census blocks and dissemination blocks were represented by points and each point was assigned to a Soil Landscape of Canada (SLC) polygon, by overlaying the SLC boundaries with representative points for small area-census information. If a representative point fell within a given SLC then it was assigned to that area. The SLC geography was then rolled-up to provide statistics at the ecoregion and ecozone levels. The boundaries for enumeration areas, census blocks and dissemination blocks may change over time and may not align with the ecological area boundaries. This misalignment occurs particularly in northern and sparsely populated regions of the country, where enumeration areas, census blocks and dissemination blocks can be very large. Therefore caution is advised when conducting time series analysis and when interpreting data for remote regions of the country."
3,"CANSIM Table 153-0057 was revised in 2017. Population and dwelling variables for 1971 to 2006 were processed using a new methodology and more accurate spatial layers for census points, shorelines, land and water. The population and dwelling densities were recalculated using the terrestrial portion of ecological areas as the denominator. Data for reference years 2011 and 2016 have been added to the table."
4,"There are 15 ecozones and 194 ecoregions in the National Ecological Framework for Canada that are composed of nested groupings of SLC polygons. An ecozone is an area of the earth's surface representative of large and very generalized ecological units characterized by interactive and adjusting abiotic and biotic factors. An ecoregion is a part of an ecozone and is characterized by distinctive regional ecological factors, including climatic, physiography, vegetation, soil, water, fauna, and land use. The boundaries of Canada's terrestrial ecozones are presented in the  terrestrial ecozone map of Canada."
5,"The term ""population centre"" was introduced for the 2011 Census and replaced the term ""urban area,"" which was used in the 1961 to 2006 censuses. The terms are defined as areas with a minimum population concentration of 1,000 persons or more and a population density of at least 400 persons per square kilometre based on the current census population count. All areas outside population centres or urban areas are classified as rural areas. Over the years, changes were made in the delineation of these areas. For more information, see the 2016 Census of Population Dictionary."
6,"Refers to a private occupied dwelling, i.e., one in which a person or group of persons is permanently residing. Also included are private occupied dwellings whose usual residents are temporarily absent on census day. Private unoccupied dwellings, i.e., dwellings in which no individuals resided on census day, but that met two conditions necessary for year-round occupancy, namely a source of heat or power and shelter from the elements, are not included in the tabulations.."
