1,"Information on the data source, the historical availability, definitions of the terms used, and the geographies available can be found at  Technical Reference Guide for the Annual Income Estimates for Census Families, Individuals and Seniors. Because they are based on a different methodology, estimates of the number of individuals and census families presented in this table differ from estimates produced by Demography Division. For questions and comments, please contact the Income Statistics Division of Statistics Canada (income@statcan.gc.ca)."
2,"Families are comprised of: 1) couples (married or common-law, including same-sex couples) living in the same dwelling with or without children, and 2) single parents (male or female) living with one or more children. Persons who are not matched to a family become persons not in census families. They may be living alone, with a family to whom they are related, with a family to whom they are unrelated or with other persons not in census families. Beginning in 2001, same-sex couples reporting as couples are counted as couple families."
3,"A couple family consists of a couple living together (married or common-law, including same-sex couples) living at the same address with or without children. Beginning in 2001, same-sex couples reporting as couples are counted as couple families."
4,"A lone-parent family is a family with only one parent, male or female, and with at least one child."
5,"This table should only be used in conjunction with income statistics produced using the T1 Family File. Because the counts available in this table are based on a different methodology, the family and person counts will differ from estimates produced by in the Demography division."
6,"The Census Standard Geographical Classification (SGC) is used for data dissemination of the census metropolitan areas and the census agglomerations: from 1997 to 2001, SGC 1996; from 2002 to 2006, SGC 2001; from 2007 to 2011, SGC 2006; from 2012 to 2015, SGC 2011; as of 2016, SGC 2016. Please note that census agglomerations were introduced in this CANSIM table in 2008."
7,"As of 2016, the census agglomeration (CA) of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu has been merged into the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Montréal."
8,"The census metropolitan area (CMA) of Ottawa-Gatineau straddles the provincial borders of Ontario and Quebec. Three census agglomerations (CA) also straddle provincial borders: Campbellton straddles New Brunswick and Quebec, Hawkesbury straddles Ontario and Quebec, and Lloydminster straddles Alberta and Saskatchewan. Data for the combined provincial parts are provided at the end of the list of CMAs and CAs. Prior to 2008, data for the two parts of the Ottawa-Gatineau CMA may be added together to provide a total for the area, with the exception of medians, percentages, indexes and averages."
9,"Children are tax filers or imputed persons in couple and lone-parent families. Tax filing children do not live with their spouse, have no children of their own and live with their parent(s). Most children are identified from the Canada Child Tax Benefit file, a provincial births file or a previous T1 family file."
10,Characteristics such as age are as of December 31 of the reference year.
11,"Median is the middle number in a group of numbers. Where a median income, for example, is given as $26,000, it means that exactly half of the incomes reported are greater than or equal to $26,000, and that the other half is less than or equal to the median amount. Starting in 2007, median incomes in the data tables are rounded to the nearest ten dollars (prior to 2007 they were rounded to the nearest hundred dollars). Zero values are not included in the calculation of medians for individuals."
12,"Total income is income from all sources. A detailed definition of what is included in total income is available from the  Technical Reference Guide for the Annual Income Estimates for Census Families, Individuals and Seniors."
