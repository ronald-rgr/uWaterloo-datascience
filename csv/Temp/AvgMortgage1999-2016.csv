1,"Economic family types are comprised of economic families (a group of two or more persons who live in the same dwelling and are related to each other by blood, marriage, common law or adoption) and persons not in an economic family (a person living either alone or with others to whom he or she is unrelated)."
2,Age group refers to age group of the major income earner in the family unit.
3,The Employer Pension Plan are valued on termination basis.
4,"CANSIM table 205-0002 replaces CANSIM table 205-0001, which is now deleted."
5,"For all types of assets and debts, the total, average and median values, as well as the number and percentage of economic entities holding, are calculated using values not equal to $0. For net worth, the total, average and median values, as well as the number and percentage of economic entities holding, are calculated using all values including net worth equal to $0."
6,"The 95% confidence interval illustrates the degree of variability associated with an estimate. Wide confidence intervals indicate high variability, thus, these estimates should be interpreted with due caution. When comparing estimates, it is important to use confidence intervals to determine if differences between values are statistically significant."
